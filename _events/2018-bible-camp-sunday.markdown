Bible Camp Sunday is June 24, 2018

This is a special Sunday between the teen and pre-teen Northwest District Camps. This year the teen camp is before this day and pre-teen camp is after. It is a time for great fellowship and hearing the word of God at the services. Come and join the campers and bring your friends.

Services in the morning at 10:30 followed by a noon meel (free will offering).
